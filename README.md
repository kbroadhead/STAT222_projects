# STAT222_projects
This repository contains two projects completed for the Fall 2020 STA/BST 222: Survival Analysis course at UC Davis. Below is a brief summary of each project.

Project 1: Concerns analysis of the well known Veterans' Administration Lung Cancer data set. Analysis is conducted using Cox Proportional Hazards Models. Analysis seeks to assess the efficacy of the experimental lung cancer treatment used in the study. The efficacy and limitations of proportional hazards models in analysisng this data set is also discussed.

Project 2: The goal of this project was to simulate and replicate the data and analysis of an existing paper in the field of survival analysis. This project uses the paper "Correlates of Furture Violence in People Being Treated for Schizophrenia" by Beuchanan, et al. Once again, Cox Proportional Hazards models stand as the primay form of analysis.
